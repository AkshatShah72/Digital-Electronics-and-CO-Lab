## Introduction


Verilog is a hardware language which is a concurrent, case-sensitive and synthesizable language. Examples of such languages are VHDL( VHSIC(Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) HDL). It is vendor independent for example, Xilinx, Verywell etc.Full form verilog is Verify Logic. It is used for Digital ICs not for Analog ICs.It uses gate level design abstraction. It was made at Gateway Design Automation and now is IEEE 1364-2001 standard. HDL came to help with the verification of design of complex circuits that are in place. Also, logic synthesis tools can convert design to any fabrication technology.

Now, verilog's basic building block is a module that provides information about input and output ports but hides internal implementation.



## Levels of abstraction
 -Behavioral Level( Design of Algorithm ) : Algorithmic and performance oriented programs are written with it.
 
  -Dataflow Level( Design of Equation ) : "assign" keyword is used for dataflow modelling. ex : assign c = a+b;
  
   -Gate Level( Interconnection with Logic Gates ) : Circuits will be defined by logic gates. ex : and(output, input) etc.
   
   ## Implementation
   
   Wrapped up in 10 labs during semester but in addition I have worked with some cool projects
